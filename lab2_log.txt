Activated the PHY40 environment and then opened up jupyter notebook.
	Added my name and section information at the top.

Began the assignment while working with Brian in Monday's lab.
	first couple of lab questions went by very smoothly.

Had trouble figuring out how to add negative binary numbers.
	discussed with Brian, who helped to deduce the correct procedure.
Confirmed that our method worked, and is what is expected of the question.

Lab question about how to get y equal to a simple value without "ghosts in the machine".
	decided to try setting y equivalency firmly as an integer.
This worked, as it doesn't change the value of y, but does allow for the "==" function to work.

Finished up the lab questions.
	saved the file and then printed to PDF.
Deactivated environment.
